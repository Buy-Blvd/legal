<p class="p2"><i>(last updated: January 31, 2024)</i></p>
<p class="p3"><i></i><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6">This Privacy Policy explains how Buy Blvd Inc. (“Buy Blvd” or “we”) collects, uses, and otherwise processes information, including personal data, about visitors to our website, app, and other products (the “Services”). This Policy is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions, found here (<a href="https://buy-blvd.github.io/terms.html">https://buy-blvd.github.io/terms.html</a>) (the “Terms”), which governs your use of the Services.  </p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>What Information We Collect</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6">As used in this Policy, “personal information” refers to information that can be used to identify you as an individual or your household.</p>

We will also collect and store your account preferences when you interact with our settings menu.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">- <i>Payment Information</i>: We offer payment processing though a third-party provider, Stripe. We do not collect, store, or otherwise process payment card or banking information, except to the extent necessary to maintain a payment preference in your account.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Information We Collect Automatically</b></p>
<p class="p6">When you access or use our Services, we may automatically collect information about your or your device, including:</p>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">- <i>Information collected from cookies and similar technologies:</i> We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, remember your shopping cart, settings and preferences, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services.

See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Buy Blvd uses cookies, and how you can disable them.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>How We Use Your Information</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6">We use the information we collect from you and about you for the primary business purpose of connecting retailers with consumers in their areas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">In addition, we may use this information to:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li>
  <li class="li6">Personalize the Services, content, and features to match user preferences;</li>
  <li class="li6">Help protect the safety of Buy Blvd and our users, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Terms and other policies;</li>
  <li class="li6">Send you account notices, reminders, updates, and other administrative messages;</li>
  <li class="li6">Provide customer support services;</li>
  <li class="li6">With your consent, send you marketing emails about our products and services, upcoming promotions, information about retailers you follow, our partners and affiliates, and other news. You may opt out of receiving such information at any time, and such marketing emails tell you how to do so. Please note, even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails (for example, emails about your account);<b> </b>and</li>
  <li class="li6">Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>How We Share Your Information</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6">Buy Blvd allows you to create and share your profile, as well as to follow retailers and users on the platform. The information you share is controlled by you, and you can choose whether to make your profile visible on your profile settings page.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">We do not sell your personal information. In addition, we only share personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">with your express consent (like when your profile is set to visible and you follow a retailer or add an item to your public wishlist);</li>
  <li class="li6">in an aggregate or anonymized format that does not identify you;</li>
  <li class="li6">as required by law, or to comply or respond to a valid government request;</li>
  <li class="li6">when we believe in good faith that it's necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or investigate fraud; and</li>
  <li class="li6">with a buyer or successor if Buy Blvd is involved in a merger, acquisition, or similar corporate transaction. If that happens, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Website of any change in ownership, as well as any choices you will have as a result.</li>
  <li class="li6">With our service providers (businesses that work for and with us) for the purpose of running the Services and fulfilling our commitments to you. These include businesses that perform services on our behalf, including to help us host and maintain our products, to provide support for legal, banking, security protection, payment processing, our own marketing, and customer service. Please know that when we share information with our service providers, it's for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and not for their independent use.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>How We Protect Your Information</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6">We use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal data within our organization. Unfortunately, transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, nor can we guarantee the security of any transmission or storage system. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as set forth below.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. If you delete your account, this will remove our access to any previously linked accounts. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Links or Content from Other Websites</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Linked Accounts</b></p>
<p class="p6">Retailers who create accounts with us can link their third-party digital inventory systems through their Shopify (or similar) accounts. This gives Buy Blvd read-only access to your digital inventory and retailer profile to allow consumers to find you and your products through the Services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Third Party Links</b></p>
<p class="p6">Our Services may contain links to other websites (like a retailer’s own site) that we do not own or operate. We do not control these sites and are not responsible for their content, products, services, or privacy policies or practices. We recommend that you review these other sites’ privacy policies and make your own determination as to your use of them.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Your Choices</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6">We may communicate with you through several different channels, including email, chat, or text. You can control which method we use to communicate in the preferences section of your profile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications (for example, by clicking the unsubscribe link) or in the preferences section of your profile. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><i>Deleting Your Account                </i></p>
<p class="p6">If you wish to delete your account, you can submit a request to delete the personal information Buy Blvd maintains about you by contacting us at <a href="mailto: support@buyblvd.com">support@buyblvd.com</a>. We may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Additional rights regarding your data</b></p>
<p class="p6">If you live in California, Colorado, or another state with heightened data privacy rights, you have some additional rights when it comes to your data.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6">Right to Delete: You can ask us to delete the personal information we have about you.</li>
  <li class="li6">Right to Know: You can ask us for a list of the categories of personal information we have about you, the categories of sources from which we get personal information, the business purposes for which we collect personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom it is shared (you can also see that in this Privacy Policy).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li6">Right to Access: You also can ask us for a copy of the pieces of personal information we have about you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">To exercise any of these rights, you (or your authorized agent) can contact us by email at<span class="s2"> </span><a href="mailto: support@buyblvd.com">support@buyblvd.com</a>. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days, and will provide a response to you within 45 days of your request, though in some exceptional cases it might take longer (if that happens, we'll let you know). We will need your name and email address to verify your request and may also ask for additional information if necessary to verify the identity of the person making the request. We reserve the right to deny your request if we cannot verify your identity, or if an exemption applies (for example, where fulfilling your request would adversely affect other individuals, or where we have a conflicting legal obligation). That said, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.<br>

<p class="p4"><b>Cookie Notice</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>What are cookies?</b></p>
<p class="p6">We collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Services, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Cookies we use</b></p>
<p class="p6">Our Platform uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Type of Cookie</b>: <i>Essential Cookies</i><br>
<b>Purpose</b>: These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the Services, identify a referring affiliate and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Type of Cookie</b>: <i>Functionality Cookies</i><br>
<b>Purpose</b>: These cookies allow us to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering open projects.<b> </b>The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use the Services.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Type of Cookie</b>: <i>Analytics and Performance Cookies</i><br>
<b>Purpose</b>: These cookies are used to collect information about our traffic and how users use the Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to the Services, the websites that referred them, the pages they, the time of day, whether they have visited before, and similar information. We use this information to help operate the Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on the Services.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6">We use Google Analytics for this purpose. You can find out more information here:  </p>

<p class="p9"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Type of Cookie</b>: <i>Social Media Cookies</i><br>
<b>Purpose</b>: These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on the Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook. The social network will record that you have done this. We also use cookies and similar technologies to personalize and measure the effectiveness of our own advertising on third-party platforms.<br>
</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Disabling cookies</b></p>
<p class="p6">You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility).  Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. </p>

<p class="p6">If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience or be unable to use the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit.</p>

<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
<p class="p5"><b></b><br></p>
