<p class="p1"><b>2. </b><span class="s1"><b>Services Overview; Your Responsibilities</b></span></p>

<p class="p1">Buy Blvd’s Services provide users with a singular platform to view, observe, organize, consolidate, track and manage different retailer inventories. The Services enables discovery and connection between shoppers (“<b>Shoppers</b>”) looking for certain products and retailers (“<b>Retailers</b>”) who can provide certain products in their public-facing store (“<b>Storefront</b>”) so that Shoppers may locate and visit Retailers. No transactions between Shoppers and Retailers take place on the Services. You hereby understand, acknowledge, and agree that any sale or purchase must be completed separately and independent from the Services.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">BY CONNECTING SHOPPERS WITH RETAILERS, BUY BLVD OPERATES AS AN ONLINE HUB THAT CONNECTS SHOPPERS WHO WISH TO DISCOVER CERTAIN PRODUCTS WITH RETAILERS WHO MAY OFFER SUCH PRODUCTS. RETAILERS ARE INDIVIDUALS AND/OR INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS AND ARE NOT EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR FRANCHISEES OF BUY BLVD IN ANY CAPACITY. BUY BLVD DOES NOT OPERATE ANY STOREFRONTS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO OPERATE ANY STOREFRONTS. BUY BLVD IS NOT A SELLER OR MERCHANT AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY STOREFRONTS OR ITEMS OR PRODUCTS SOLD BY RETAILERS. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUY BLVD DOES NOT SUPERVISE, SCOPE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR STOREFRONTS OR ITEMS OR PRODUCTS SOLD BY RETAILERS AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE STOREFRONTS AND ITEMS AND PRODUCTS PROVIDED THEREIN IN ANY MANNER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, STATUTE, ORDINANCE, REGULATION, OR CODE. Any reference on the Services to a “tag” or “category” designation, indicates only that a user has completed a relevant account registration process, taken certain action, provided certain information or met certain criteria within the Services in order to display such description and/or information and does not represent anything else. Any such <br>
“tag” or “category” designation and/or information is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Buy Blvd. Instead, any such description and/or information provided within the Services is intended to be useful details for users to discover and evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of other users with whom they select and interact with via the Services.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Buy Blvd is not responsible for the performance or communications of users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Storefronts and products, and users, nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any users, or of any ratings or reviews provided by users with respect to each other. Buy Blvd makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Storefronts and/or products requested or provided by, or the communications of or between, users identified through the Services, whether in public or private, via on- or off-line interactions, or otherwise howsoever. While Retailers may, in Buy Blvd’s sole discretion, be subject to a review process before they can register for and during their use of the Services, which may include but is not limited to identity verification, Buy Blvd cannot confirm that any user is who they claim to be, and Buy Blvd cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information of users. Nothing herein shall be an obligation on Buy Blvd in connection with any review process.</p>
